# UCD Major Planner Scraper

This is a scraper for a potential major planner for UC Davis.

In its current form, it latches on to the myDegree api to get data about major requirements. To do this, it needs what's called a bearer token. Ask Tim how to get your bearer token, and once you do get it, you want to put it a file called 'bearer.token' in the uppermost directory.
